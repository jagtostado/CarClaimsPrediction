Car insurance claim prediction using GLM and XGBoost
# 🚗 Car Claims Prediction

This project aims to predict the expected number of car insurance claims using both classical statistical and modern machine learning techniques.  
It combines exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model comparison between **Generalized Linear Models (Poisson)** and **XGBoost**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict car insurance claim frequency.
- Compare performance between GLM (Poisson regression) and XGBoost models.
- Evaluate model accuracy and interpretability from an actuarial perspective.

---

## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Data Exploration:** Understanding distributions and relationships between features.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Transforming and encoding variables for optimal model performance.  
3. **Modeling:**
   - Poisson GLM using `statsmodels`
   - XGBoost model for boosted regression
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing prediction accuracy and residual behavior.
